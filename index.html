            <div class="aboutText">
                Pottery is a unique skill i learnt when i was in primary school. We(classmates) were
                told to create beautiful pieces out of clay which some of my classmates pieces were on the top list of best including mine.
                Although some of my classmates pieces
                where incredibly strange but still unique. They didn't fully master the elements of 
                great pottery. But at the end, I learnt something from my classmates pieces that 
                weren't realistic.
                What was that ? <br>

                What can sound so melodious. Its beautiful sound can wipe all your sorrows away.
                Its the violin.
                The violin reminds me of perfection in disguise.
                You may ask, Kebin, What do you mean ?
                I mean that the melodious sound the violin creates, makes me wonder, how such a small instrument
                could produce such a great and magnificent sound.

               Some may ask, Kebin who made this your pathetic website ? (Lol)
               <br>Just kidding.
               My answer would be that...<br>
               I made it myself. One of my skill is computer Programming.
               Programming has really challenged me to put my brain and intellect to the test. It 
               makes me to improve and explore what i could possibly do with my knowledge in computer
               Programming.<i><u>Sometimes you cannot know what you are capable of except you are put to test.

           Belief is powerful <br>
           It shapes your thoughts, actions and future.<br>
           Do you know what believing in something does ? <br>
           It makes what others see as impossible a reality to you. <br>
           You know what ? I believe in God and that He exists even if no one agrees.<br>
           I believe that He is watching and guiding me.

                Purpose defines a person. <br>
                Have you ever asked yourself before, why was i born ? <br>
                I don't know about you, but i don't think that people were born
                just to occupy the earth. I believe that everyone is unique and has a role to
                play in other to achieve greatness. Sometimes the role you play would affect generations to come
                ,but in the end, if you fulfill your purpose, then I believe you would be happy.

                Maintaining balance is essential in our lives <br>
                We would not be able to maintain this balance if our minds are stressed.
